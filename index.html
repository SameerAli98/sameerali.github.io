            <h3>Blockchain based Digital Identity Management</h3>
            <p>
              A project aimed to provide secure method of storing and sharing
              digital credentials, certificates and degrees. It utilizes
              decentralized networks to eliminate storage of important
              credentials on vulnerable servers that are prone to hijacking and
              hacking. The blockchain architecture makes sure that the
              credentials are tamper-proof by generating Non-fungible tokens of
              the credentials. It uses smart contracts written in clarity and is
              built on Stacks Blockchain, Node.js and React Framework, paired
              with Gaia as the cloud provider for storing secured credentials.

            <h3>Interactive 2-Player Chess</h3>
            <p>
              Developed a two-player chess game in C++ using Object-Oriented
              Programming (OOP) and the GP142 GUI library. Designed the game
              with modular classes for each chess piece, encapsulating movement
              rules and interactions. Implemented standard chess rules,
              turn-based play, and move validation. The GP142 library provided a
              graphical interface, enabling click-and-drag piece movement and
              valid move highlighting. This project enhanced my skills in OOP,
              game state management, and GUI development.

            <h3>AI-based Interactive Connect 4</h3>
            <p>
              Developed an AI-based Connect Four game in Java utilizing the
              Minimax algorithm for decision-making. Implemented the game logic
              and AI opponent, enabling the computer to evaluate potential moves
              and select optimal plays based on future outcomes. The Minimax
              algorithm, enhanced with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency,
              ensured competitive AI performance. This project honed my skills
              in artificial intelligence, algorithm optimization, and strategic
              game development.
